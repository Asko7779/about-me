**About Me**
- *Hey, I'm Asko7779, also known as simply Asko. I am a software engineer and a cybersecurity professional specializing in both the defensive and offensive field.*

**My Projects**
- *My projects include various types of softwares, here are some examples:*

- **1. AskoOS (aOS)** - *My own cybersecurity-focused operating system I wrote from scratch in C,C++ and Rust, along with my own simple kernel which is still in development.*
- **2. Assembly Bootloader** - *A simple 16-bit assembly bootloader I made for aOS, nothing too complex but works.*
- **3. Exploit Development** - *I've developed many exploits and attack simulation tools, such as C2 servers, DDoS simulation programs, botnets or even malwares.*
- **4. Custom Payloads** - *Some of my projects include custom payloads, such as reverse shells, keyloggers, webcam capturing spywares and programs self-injecting themselves into memory, making them hard to detect - all of these mostly written in C, C++, Rust and Assembly.*
- **5. Defensive Systems** - *Along with exploit development, I also develop defensive softwares to protect against them, such as DDoS protection tools, file scanners, antiviruses, ransomware detection & handling programs and many more.*
- **6. Digital Forensics** - *One of my favorite cybersecurity fields, digital forensics - another one of my frameworks, still in development.*
- **7. System Programming** - *Apart from cybersecurity, my other focus is system programming, such as: Operating systems, embedded systems, security mechanisms, applications and so on.*

**I am proficient in multiple programming language, which include:**
*Java, Python, C/C++, C#, Rust, Assembly, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, Lua and I'm still learning more to expand my knowledge*


I am constantly learning new things everyday and actively expanding my knowledge to inspire and share it with other fellow programmers and beginners, whether you are a C++ veteran or a complete beginner.
